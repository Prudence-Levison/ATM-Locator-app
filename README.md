# ATM-Locator-app

This project presents the design and implementation of a map-based ATM locator web application that automatically detects and stores the location of ATM points visited by users. The application uses browser geolocation and a free map tool (Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap) to collect and display ATM locations. Users do not manually enter data; the system captures their coordinates and selected bank/status when they are physically near an ATM. All ATMs are displayed on a map, with markers indicating their availability status, allowing users to quickly find functioning ATMs within their area.
